# SPARQL Queries ACS Synthetic Biology
  This is a repository with a set of sparql queries to answer questions posed in an ACS Synthetic Biology Paper titled: The Synthetic Biology Knowledge System
  Queries should be run in the [sparql interface of synbioks.org](https://synbioks.org/sparql).

  Each query comes as a template where variables are indicated as <variable> and as an example query (fully functional). The different queries are described bellow.
  
## SPARQL Basics
  Any line starting with ```#``` in SPARQL is a comment meaning it will not do anything but describes the code or can be removed to add an additional feature.
  For more information on SPARQL see the SPARQL 1.1 [W3 Overview](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/). 

## Papers by Keyword
  An example of a query might be 'What are some papers about metabolic engineering?' or 'What are some papers about yeast?' or 'What are some papers about S. cerevisiae?'.
  The [example file](https://github.com/synbioks/SPARQL-queries-ACS-Synbio/blob/main/papers_by_keyword_example.sparql) and the [template file](https://github.com/synbioks/SPARQL-queries-ACS-Synbio/blob/main/papers_by_keyword_template.sparql). Remember to copy the PREFIX section too and to remove the prefilled PREFIX lines in the synbioks sparql interface.
